## Abstract

**Problem.** Evaluate some popular self-healing driver options.

**Importance.** Self-healing drivers can reduce automation maintenance costs by automatically detecting changes in the web page layout and updating locators to ensure the test cases are functional [1].

**Method.** For DotNet we implemented a sample project using Selenium.WebDriver.SelfHealing (the only available package in the NuGet repositories), and for Java we implemented a project that uses TestRigor and Healenium. We evaluated all implementations against the tests proposed by each one:

    * Test #1: 
    * Test #2: 

**Results.** To be defined...

**Future work.** Find more examples or scenarios of broken locators to evaluate the implemented libraries and incorporate more libraries.
