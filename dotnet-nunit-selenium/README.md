# Self-healing locators investigation
Juan Fonseca, Gorilla Logic 2024.

PoC for implementing Self Healing Locators in a Selenium DotNet project.

# Creation [1, 2]
```
dotnet new nunit
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver --version 4.24.0
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver.SelfHealing --version 0.99.21-beta.1
```

# Execution
```
dotnet test SelfHealingLocatorsDemo.csproj -l:trx;
```

# Tools
## Selenium.WebDriver.SelfHealing [3]
Library that implements self-healing, auto-wait, and selector-optimizations. 
* **Self-healing:** web elements can still be found when they change position (avoid stale element error).
* **Auto-wait:** "waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions" (avoid "element cannot be found" error).
* **Selector-optimization.**

* This library doesn't solve the problem of finding a locator with a renamed attribute (for instance, a mispelled ID), and it is constrained by an usage quota:

> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee is granted a right to use the Software for small projects and evaluation purposes without charge provided that use of the Software is within the “Free Usage Quota” published on Licensor’s website

> Upon exceeding the Free Usage Quota limits, Licensee must obtain License Key for continued use of the Software or cease using the Software.

> The Software contains features that removes technical restrictions and automatically disables the Software upon exceeding the free usage limits.

Disadvantages:
* The [quota page](deliveryassured.com.au/selenium.webdriver.selfhealing) is broken.
* It is not mentioned where the "innovative self-healing algorithm" is used and if it uses Artificial Intelligence.
